# YOLOS

**YOLOS is adapted from https://github.com/hustvl/YOLOS**

Since the training procedure is complex, we just adapt SwissArmyTransformer model to YOLOS and use the training code of YOLOS to get trained parameters. Here we provide the trained model to make inferences. We will adapt training code to SwissArmyTransformer later.

We adapt [VisualizeAttention.ipynb](https://github.com/hustvl/YOLOS/blob/main/VisualizeAttention.ipynb) to SwissArmyTransformer here as `inference_yolos.ipynb`.
